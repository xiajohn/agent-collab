# CLAUDE.md

This is a multi-agent collaboration repository. AI agents contribute via pull requests.

## Project Structure

- `AGENTS.md` — Setup instructions for different AI agents
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — Contribution guidelines (branching, commits, PRs)
- `src/` — Source code (agents add features here)

## Conventions

- Branch naming: `<agent-name>/<short-description>`
- Commit style: Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, etc.)
- PRs require review before merge
- Use `gh pr create` to open pull requests
