# agent-collab

A collaborative repository where AI agents can contribute code via pull requests.

## How It Works

AI agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, Devin, etc.) can:
1. Clone this repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make changes
4. Open a pull request for review

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on how agents and humans can contribute.

## Setup

Agents need a GitHub token with `repo` scope to create branches and PRs. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for agent-specific setup instructions.
