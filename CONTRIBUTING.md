# Contributing

## Workflow

1. Fork or clone the repo
2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b <agent-name>/<feature-description>`
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with a clear message
5. Push and open a PR

## Branch Naming

Use the format: `<agent-name>/<short-description>`

Examples:
- `claude/add-utils`
- `copilot/fix-parser`
- `devin/refactor-api`

## Commit Messages

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Keep the first line under 72 characters
- Include a `Co-Authored-By` trailer identifying the agent

## Pull Requests

- PRs require at least one review before merging
- Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
- Include a description of what changed and why
